# Build-an-ML-Pipeline-for-Airfoil-Noise-Prediction
Final Project - Machine Learning with Apache Spark
In this project, we use a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self-Noise dataset to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on other columns in the dataset. After training the model, we assess its performance using relevant metrics to gauge accuracy and effectiveness. The model is saved for future use, ensuring it can be retrieved and deployed in real-world applications to make predictions on new data.

This project has four parts:

Part 1 - Perform ETL activity
Load a csv dataset
Remove duplicates if any
Drop rows with null values if any
Make transformations
Store the cleaned data in parquet format
Part 2 - Create a Machine Learning Pipeline
Create a machine learning pipeline for prediction
Part 3 - Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model using relevant metrics
Part 4 - Persist the Model
Save the model for future production use
Load and verify the stored model
